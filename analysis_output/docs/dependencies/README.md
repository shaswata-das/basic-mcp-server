# Dependencies

The server runs on **Python 3.11+** and relies primarily on standard libraries plus a few third-party packages:

- `aiohttp` and `websockets` for asynchronous networking
- `aiofiles` for non-blocking file access
- `python-dotenv` for environment configuration
- `psutil` for system information

These packages can be installed using `pip` as shown in the project [`README.md`](../../README.md#installation).
