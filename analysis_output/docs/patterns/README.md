# Design and Architecture Patterns

This section documents the design patterns, architectural patterns, and code organization patterns used in the codebase.

## Design Patterns

No specific design patterns were detected in the codebase.

## Architectural Patterns

No specific architectural patterns were detected in the codebase.

## Code Organization

### Feature-based Organization

**Confidence**: high

**Sources**: folder_structure

**Description**: The code is organized around features or business capabilities, with each feature having its own directory containing all related components. This promotes high cohesion within features and clear boundaries between them.

### Layer-based Organization

**Confidence**: high

**Sources**: folder_structure

**Description**: The code is organized in horizontal layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access). This separation promotes a clear distinction of responsibilities and allows for easier maintenance and testing of each layer.

### Component-based Organization

**Confidence**: high

**Sources**: folder_structure

**Description**: The code is organized around reusable components, each with a specific responsibility. Components can be composed to build features, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
